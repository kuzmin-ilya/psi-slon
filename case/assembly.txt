We used the following D-SUB 9/9 packaging:
* DS1061 (CONNFLY)
http://www.connfly.com/productshow.aspx?id=331

The datasheet is downloaded from the manufactorer site and is not part of the project.

In the digikey other similar model is presented:
https://www.norcomp.net/series/957-series-dsub-backshell
Its size slightly differs from DS1061. You may consider it consulting the manufactorer's 
datasheet  (DC99_connfly.pdf)

The drilling template is drawn in PCB editor so one may order it in the one project with 
the main board (root folder).
